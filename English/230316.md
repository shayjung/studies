It is an undeniable fact that people in the modern era tend to purchase more manufactured products compared with previous eras. However, people in every era have always desired to possess what they want in spite of their varied historical backgrounds. Thus, it is more essential to seek obvious causes and efficient solutions to protect unique traditions than to discourage customers from consuming.
First of all, it is worth mentioning that there is no clear evidence that consumption in modern times destroys cultures. Rather it could encourage various customs to develop in ways such as tourism, promotional souvenirs, or museums. These kinds of advertising can be good illustrations regarding how to preserve traditions of the provinces.
Meanwhile, the cause to ruin traditional cultures does not lie in the way people purchase but the change of society which they belong to. For instance, the symbol of phone call changed from the shape of a classic telephone to that of a smartphone keypad, which is more familiar to young generations. Nevertheless, it does not mean that the changed image has a negative effect on the value of telephone itself.
Although I agree with the opinion that losing original customs is a pity thing, it is not because of a new spending trend of consumers. The thing is that efforts to find appropriate ways to maintain our own traditional properties, such as tourism as I mentioned, are much more necessary.
