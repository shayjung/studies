Some people say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together.
To what extent do you agree that the internet is making it easier for people to communicate with on another.

In today's world, due to the advancement of technology new inventions are coming into existence.
It is true that 'Necessity is a mother of invention.'
The Internet is sjust like a wonder box, which contains every type of information.
Besides, it has also proved to be a very important tool to connect people with one another.

In today's modernized era, nobody has enough/sufficient time to write letters to their loved ones.
Moreover, it also takes longer to send or receive any information, but the Internet is the easiest way to send messages to our precious ones.
Communication can be either in the form of email or through text messages sent via the Internet to mobile phones.
We can send and receive messages straight away.

On the other hand, today's young generation mostly perfers to chat through the Internet.
During such chatting we can write messages and get replies straight away.
Moreover voice chatting is becoming more popular every day.

In reality, the advantages and disadvantages resemble two sides of one coin, so as any other thing the Internet also have some downsides, such as causing people health problems including poor eye-sight, back ache or migraines.
Today's teenagers usually prefers to spend their time on the Internet rather than to participate in other physical activities, which causing them to have a weaker physical health.

To conclude, I would like to say that the Internet is one of the most modernized and most successful tools not only for communication, but also for getting the most relevant information regarding every field in a very short period of time.
